Emergency Call System (this an application that you activate before you might bet into an emergency situation (i.e. before walkthrough alone through a tunnel). Then you have to press a button on the screen, and as soon as you lift the finger from that button, the device will send an emergency call to a friend/the police and send the current position, sound and video to another device or internet portal.
